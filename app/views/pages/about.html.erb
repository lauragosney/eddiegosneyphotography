        <p>Welcome to my website.</p>

      <p>After a career in advertising, I have been able to return to my first love photography, which I studied at college as part of my graphics course, many years ago.</p>

      <p>My work reflects the places I’ve visited, the area in Buckinghamshire England where I live and the people and interesting things in life I meet and see day by day.</p>

      <p>Each print [unless indicated] is available in a limited edition of twenty five. The prints measure about 36x23cms and come with a mount measuring 50x40cms for easy framing. Each print costs £65 plus postage and packaging or £105 framed in a black wooden frame plus postage and packaging.</p>

      <p>For more information, or to make a purchase, please contact me at <%= mail_to "eddiegosney@btinternet.com" %> </p>
